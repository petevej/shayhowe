### Why am I doing this?

HTML and CSS is sometimes viewed as a stepping stone to JavaScript and the greatness of the web. Most people just skip straight to using Bootstrap framework and while that is ok in most instances, I really do want to understand how to customize the aesthetics of webpages before using ready-made tools.
